## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Code daily** - Consistency beats intensity
2. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn immediately
3. **Read others' code** - Study open-source projects
4. **Embrace failure** - Debug with curiosity, not frustration
5. **Join communities** - Learn from peers and mentors
6. **Document your journey** - Keep notes on what you learn
7. **Teach others** - Explaining solidifies understanding
8. **Focus on fundamentals** - They transfer across technologies
9. **Practice communication** - Technical and non-technical
10. **Be patient** - Progress is rarely linear

## üß≠ Adjusting Your Path

This roadmap is flexible. Customize based on:

- Prior experience (adjust timelines accordingly)
- Career goals (product companies, agencies, freelancing)
- Regional job market demands
